Example Data
-----------

Example electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data files can be downloaded from Zenodo. Please download these data files and unzip them into this folder, to run an example analysis with MTEX-texture-block-analysis.

The EBSD data for a hot-rolled Ti-6Al-4V sample recorded along the TD-ND plane (in the RD direction) can be downloaded from material_data.zip in [Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Dataset - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7311306)
