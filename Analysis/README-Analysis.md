Example Analysis
-----------

Example analysis files can be downloaded from Zenodo. Please download these analysis files and unzip them into this folder, to compare with your own example analysis with MTEX-texture-block-analysis.

The analysis files for a hot-rolled Ti-6Al-4V sample recorded along the TD-ND plane (in the RD direction) can be downloaded from ebsd.zip in [Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction Results - Measuring Bulk Crystallographic Texture from Differently-Orientated Ti-6Al-4V Samples](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7319352)
